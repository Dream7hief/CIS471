Q1.1
    • State space representation: Coordinate (x,y) for current location of insect
    • State space size: (m*n)

Q1.2
    • State space representation: Coordinate (x,y) for current location and current facing direction of insect
    • State space size: (4*m*n)

Q1.3
    • State space representation: Set of coordinates <(x1,y1), (x2,y2), …, (xk,yk)> for the locations of k insects
    • State space size: (m*n)^k

Q2
    1. DFS:
        Order states are expanded: [S,A,B,D,G]
        Path: S->A->B->D->G
    2. BFS:
        Order states are expanded: [S,A,C,B,F,E,D,G]
        Path: S->C->E->G
    3. UCS:
        Order states are expanded: [S,C,A,E,F,B,D,G]
        Path: S->C->E->G
    4. Greedy:
        Order states are expanded: [S,A,B,D,G]
        Path: S->A->B->D->G
    5. A*:
        Order states are expanded: [S,A,C,E,F,G]
        Path: S->C->E->G
    6. Admissible Heuristics:
        The Heuristics are admissible given that for all nodes n, h(n) <= h*(n)
    7. Consistent Heuristics:
        The Heuristics are admissible - h(C) </= c(C,E) + h(E) (rather 8 </= 7)
        Therefore, node C would need to have its heuristic cost to 7

Q3
    1. Path returned: S->A->D-G

    2. True statements: (a)(b)
